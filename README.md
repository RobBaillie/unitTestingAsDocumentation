# unitTestingAsDocumentation

The files in this repo forms part of the Unit Testing as Documentation presentations.

Some files may have been used in the presentation directly, some are included as supporting examples in case some questions arise that merit their use - or for later examination.

As these files don't form part of a complete Salesforce repository, they do not necesserily compile in a sandbox without work to make them compatible with the objects in that sandbox.

The files are free to be used as guides and aids in learning, but are not to be used directly in production systems.  They come with no warranty or support.

Comments are welcomed.
