# unitTestingAsDocumentation

The files in this repo form part of the Unit Testing as Documentation presentation.

Some files were used in the presentation directly, or are included as supporting examples in case some questions arise that merit their use.

Not all have been explicitly tested and so may not be 100% syntactically correct, although all are based on real world Salesforce examples.

The files are free to be used as guides and aids in learning, but are not to be used directly in production systems.  They come with no warranty or support.

Comments are welcomed.
